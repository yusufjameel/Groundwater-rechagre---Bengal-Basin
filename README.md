The code implements the Bayesian isotope mixing model to estimated the fractional contribution of the different sources at the distribution sites for June 2015. Please refer to section 2.4 of the paper for details on methodology. Raw data sets for other months analyzed within this study can be accessed through the Waterisotopes database (http://waterisotopes.org, project ID 00065, Waterisotopes Database,2018).

Plese install JAGS (https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/) in addition to all the R packages to run the model.
