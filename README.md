Jameel, Y; H Michael, A Van Geen, M Stahl, and C Harvey (in review, Nature Communications earth and environment). Replumbing the Bengal Basin: A shift in recharge driven by groundwater irrigation revealed by stable water isotopes. Preprint availabe at https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-457036/v1


In this project, three monte carlo isotope mixing models were developed to calculate the contribution of different possible sources (precipitation, rivers, ponds and irrigation water) to shallow groundwater recharge in the Bengal Basin. The code included in this repository is used to implement the model that includes all the possible endmembers (precipitation, rivers, ponds and rice fields). Please contact yjameel@mit.edu for data.
